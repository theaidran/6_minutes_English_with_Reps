## Overview
A simple web application to enhance English language learning through video playlists and a flashcard system.
The main goal here was to create an app as a simple HTML file, which you run straight from your desktop, no servers, no frameworks, no API required.
Basicly, it is a clean YouTube player where you can add notes to each video and save it as a flashcard. Later, you can switch to the Repetitions site and start the review process.
It has compatibility with ANKI format, so you can export/inport flashcards to your favorite mobile/desktop app.
Also, it has integration of dictionaries like onelook.com, and you can add your own. But due to fact it is just a simple iframe, some websites may not work due to their policy.  

## How It Works
1. Select an built-in BBC playlist or add your own video/playlist.
2. Add new words or phrases while watching and check them with the integrated dictionary.
3. Review notes/flashcards based on a simple spaced repetition system.
4. Track progress through statistics.

## Tips
Navigate the dictionary frame with your browser navigation bar (go back, refresh).
Ads from YouTube should not be displayed when run locally. Anyway, extensions like uBlock Origin work.
