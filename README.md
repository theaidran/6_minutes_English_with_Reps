BBC learning English with repetitions

## Overview
A simple web application to enhance English language learning through video playlists and a flashcard system.
The main goal here was to create an app as a simple HTML file, which you run straight from your desktop, no servers, no frameworks, no API required.
Basicly, it is a clean YouTube player where you can add notes to each video and save it as a flashcard. Later, you can switch to the Repetitions card and start the review process.
It has compatibility with ANKI format, so you can export/inport flashcards to your favorite mobile/desktop app.
Also, it has integration of dictionaries like onelook.com, and you can add your own. But due to fact it is just a simple iframe, some websites may not work due to their policy.

## How It Works
1. Select an integrated playlist or add your own.
2. Add new words or phrases while watching.
3. Review flashcards based on a simple spaced repetition system.
4. Track progress through statistics.
5. Navigate the dictionary frame with your browser navigation bar (go back, refresh).
